JavaScript code can be located in different places
In your HTML code between <script> and </script> tag
In local files, usually ending with the .js suffix (i.e: in a script.js file)
, and included using, for example, a syntax such as: <script src="style.js"></script> tag
In external files located on the Web, using their URLs, also
using the <script src="https://www.aserver.com/..../js/script.js"></script> tag


Putting JavaScript code in external scripts files is easy, and offers many advantages:

It separates HTML and code (and also CSS code, if you use external CSS files)
It makes HTML and JavaScript easier to read and maintain
JavaScript files can be reused more easily in other projects
Cached JavaScript files can speed up page load

It is also possible to use the "real dev. tool console", and for this, I recommend running 
the application in a single window, not in the Js Bin editor.
Press the black arrow on the top right of the output window - this will 
render the page as a standalone Web page, then press F12
