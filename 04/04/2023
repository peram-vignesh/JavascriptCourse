Example 1: page title
Good page titles are particularly important for orientation — 
to help people know where they are and move between pages 
open in their browser. The first thing screen readers say w
hen the user goes to a different Web page is the page title. In the 
Web page markup, they are the <title> within the <head>.

Check #1: There is a title that adequately
and briefly describes the content of a page, and 
that it distinguishes the page from other Web page

Example 2: image text alternatives ("alt text")
Text alternatives ("alt text") are a primary way of m
aking visual information accessible, because they can
be rendered through any sensory modality (for example, visual, auditory or tactile) 
to match the needs of the user. Providing text alternatives allows the information 
to be rendered in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents. For example,
a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.
Check #2: Every image has alt with appropriate alternative text.
Example: See the W3C logo below. It contains a link that points to the 
W3C Web site. The text alternative is going to be a brief description of the link target.
