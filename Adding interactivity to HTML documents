The event object contains some
important properties and methods that are common to all types of events:

evt.type: the name of the event
evt.target: for example, is the HTML element that has fired the event. In our previous examples
with the click listeners on a button, evt.target in the event listener is the button itself.
evt.stopPropagation(): will not propagate the event to all other elements that listen to it. 
If several elements are registered for a click event - for example, you have a click listener 
on a button and on the window (the whole page). If you click on the button, and if in its click
event listener you call evt.stopPropagation(); then the click event listener on the window object
will never be called.
evt.preventDefault(): the default browser behavior will not be executed. For example, in a 'contextmenu' 
event listener attached to an object, if you call evt.preventDefault(), instead of having the right click
default context menu of your browser displayed, you'll be able to display your own context menu, like in this example.
It also contains properties that are associated with the type of the event, for example:

evt.button: the mouse button that has been used in the case of a mouse event listener
evt.keyCode: the code of the key that has been used
evt.pageX: coordinate of the mouse relative to the page
etc.
In the subsequent sections of this course we will look at the most common
types of events in detail.
