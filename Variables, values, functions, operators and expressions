A function allows you to group code, give it a name and be able to execute it by calling it by name.
Functions always return a value:
Explicitly, using the keyword return followed by the value (line 3 of the next example),
Implicitly, in which case the return value is undefined.
Add an element at the end of an array using the push method
Since arrays are objects, we can do much more with them - in particular,
they have more properties and more methods than the push method. You will learn more 
about this in a later lesson (Arrays part 2), but for the moment, let's focus on the most useful features...
Strings are arrays of characters! 
Consequence:
They are objects too! 
They have a length property,
Each individual character can be accessed using an index
There are many reasons to use simple quotes when possible:
Double quotes are used in HTML
You must hold the Shift key to type "
Single quotes are easier to read and to type
To output HTML in JavaScript, single quotes are more useful
010 equals 8 which means 1 * 8^1 + 0 * 8^0
The number 0456 means 4 * 8^2 + 5 * 8^1 + 6 * 8^0
Question 1: What's the result, as an integer, of the operation: 24 - 024?
Explanation 1: 24 is an integer which equals 24 but 024 is an octal value which equals 20.
Question 2: Which value will be displayed in the devtool console if you type 098 followed by the Enter key?
Explanation 2: 9 and 8 don't exist in base 8 (only 0 to 7), so the typed number will be considered as an integer.
Hexadecimal: 0xF3
0xFF equals 255, 0xF3 means 15 * 16^1 + 3 * 16^0 and the resulting value is 243
Examples of octal and hexadecimal data types:
