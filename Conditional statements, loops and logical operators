Logical operators
The logical operators are: 

&& (AND)  
usage example : if ((x  > 0) && (x < 10)) {
                 console.log('x is strictly positive and less than 10');
             }
|| (OR)
usage  example : if ((x  > 0) || (x == -5)) { 
                 console.log('x is positive or equal to -5'); 
             }
! (NOT)
usage example : if (!(x  > 0)) { 
                 console.log('x is not positive (x is less or equal to 0'); 
             }
&&, || operators are binary, ! is unary. 

Implicit conversions of non boolean values in expressions
Used with logical operators or within statements, non-boolean values are implicitly converted to booleans.  

All the following values are evaluated as false :

false
undefined
null
0
NaN
the empty string ''
Everything else is evaluated as true!

Comparison operators
Equal ==
Not equal !=
Greater than >
Greater than or equal >=
Less than <
Less than or equal to <=
Strict equal ===
Strict not equal !==

The if-then-else ternary operator
This ternary operator is a shortcut version of if...then...else.
